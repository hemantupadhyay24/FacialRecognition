# FacialRecognition
Simple Facial Recognition using facial_recognition library
In this example, I have written a code for detecting my face in from unknown image using facial_recognition library built by Adam Geitgey. 
Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
